description: '[GZoltar](https://github.com/gzoltar/gzoltar) is a Java toolset for fault localization. It has the infrastructure to automatically instrument the source code of software programs to produce runtime data and analyze it in order to return a ranked list of faults candidates based on spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) formulas. This action parses the fault localization report produced by [GZoltar](https://github.com/gzoltar/gzoltar) and posts a comment on the pull request or commit with the list of suspicious lines of code and their probability of being faulty.'
